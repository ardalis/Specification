# Specification

Base class with tests for adding specifications to a DDD model. Currently used in Microsoft reference application [eShopOnWeb](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnWeb), which is the best place to see it in action. Check out Steve "ardalis" Smith's associated (free!) eBook, [Architecting Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Azure](https://aka.ms/webappebook), as well.

## Sample Usage

The Specification pattern pulls query-specific logic out of other places in the application where it currently exists. For applications with minimal abstraction that use EF Core directly, the specification will eliminate `Where`, `Include`, `Select` and similar expressions from almost all places where they're being used. In applications that abstract database query logic behind a `Repository` abstraction, the specification will typically eliminate the need for many custom `Repository` implementation classes as well as custom query methods on `Repository` implementations. Instead of many different ways to filter and shape data using various methods, the same capability is achieved with just this code:

```csharp
public async Task<IReadOnlyList<T>> ListAsync(ISpecification<T> spec)
{
  var specificationResult = await ApplySpecification(spec);
  return await specificationResult.ToListAsync();
}
private async Task<IQueryable<T>> ApplySpecification(ISpecification<T> spec)
{
  return await EfSpecificationEvaluator<T>.GetQuery(_dbContext.Set<T>().AsQueryable(), spec);
}
```

Now to use this method, the calling code simply instantiates the appropriate specification implementation. Specifications should be defined in an easily-discovered location in the application, so developers can easily reuse them. The use of this pattern helps to eliminate many commonly duplicated lambda expressions in applications, reducing bugs associated with this duplication.

## Running the tests

This project needs a database to test, since a lot of the tests validate that a specification is translated from LINQ to SQL by EF Core. To run the tests, we're using docker containers, including a docker-hosted SQL Server instance. You run the tests by simply running `RunTests.bat` or `RunTests.sh`.
